# Description
ELDYN is a tool that allows manipulating files by priorly defining variables or templates inside a file that should be adjusted dynamically. This works ideal for LaTeX, due to the nature of the WYSIWYM writing approach. ELDYN allows inputting a JSON file containing (your own) variables and outputting it into personalized templates. This makes ELDYN a candidate for dynamically creating certificates, invoices, documentation, labels and more.

# Usage
ELDYN requires three arguments:
- Path to JSON file
- Path to template directory
- Path to output file

E.g., ```ELDYN "C:\Users\dusti\Desktop\ELDYNPub\Learn\Entry-certificate\Certificate.json" "C:\Users\dusti\Desktop\ELDYNPub\Learn\Entry-certificate\Temp" "C:\Users\dusti\Desktop\ELDYNPub\Learn\Entry-certificate\Out\Certificate.tex"```

# Requirements
- .NET Framework Installed
